# `content_file` function

This function is decorated with `@bp.route("/content/<path>")` and `@authenticated_path`, indicating that it's a route handler for the path `/content/<path>` and requires authentication.

## Parameters

- `path`: A string representing the path of the file to be served.
- `auth_claims`: A dictionary containing authentication claims.

## Functionality

1. The function first checks if the path contains a page number (e.g., `filename-1.txt`). If it does, the page number is removed to get the actual filename (e.g., `filename.txt`).

2. It then logs the opening of the file.

3. The function attempts to download the blob (file) from the blob storage using the provided path. If the blob is not found in the general Blob container, it logs this information.

4. If user uploads are enabled (`CONFIG_USER_UPLOAD_ENABLED` is `True`), the function tries to download the file from the user's specific directory in the Data Lake Storage. The user's directory is determined by their `oid` (Object ID) from the `auth_claims`.

5. If the file is still not found, it logs this exception and aborts the request with a 404 status code.

## Notes

- This function is designed to work within an Azure environment, using Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage.
- The function is part of a Flask application, as indicated by the use of `@bp.route` and `current_app.config`.
- The function is designed to be slow and memory-intensive, as it downloads files from blob storage for each request. This is not recommended for production environments.
